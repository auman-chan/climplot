[climplot](https://gitee.com/auman-chan/climplot) aims to collect
crucial climate data for global locations and render the Walter &
Lieth climatic diagrams in a more user-friendly and personalized manner.

The main features of the package are:

-   The use of worldwide climate data to obtain standardized and
    reliable data for drawing Walter & Lieth climatic diagrams
-   The provision for more parameter to customize the plots and display
    comprehensive information

The package offers functions for:

-   Obtain climate data to draw Walter & Lieth Climatic Diagram for
    global locations
-   Draw the Walter & Lieth climatic diagram
-   Revise the color scheme and information presentation of the diagram

## Installing and loading

To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) and
[gitee](https://gitee.com/), you will need the R packages
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) and
[git2r](https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r). If you want to install the vignettes of this package, please add `build_vignettes= TRUE`.
>>>>>>> dev

```{r intasll, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('remotes')

#from github
remotes::install_github("auman-chan/climplot")
#from gitee
install.packages('git2r')
remotes::install_git("https://gitee.com/auman-chan/climplot.git")

#add vignettes
remotes::install_github("auman-chan/climplot",build_vignettes= TRUE)

remotes::install_git("https://gitee.com/auman-chan/climplot.git",
                     build_vignettes= TRUE)
```

```{r load package,include=FALSE}
#load package
library(climplot)
```

## Data preparation

The climate data provided by Worldclim is indispensable, however, due to
its global-scale raster layer format, the file size are substantial and
cannot be accommodated within the package. Therefore, kindly obtain the
climate dataset from [Figshare](NULL) before use.

The dataset comprises of four folders and a total of 48 .tif files,
which include annual average minimum temperature, annual average maximum
temperature, annual average precipitation, and annual extreme minimum
temperature.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Eaxmple

### Extraction of climate data

Information of the target locations should be ready for the
extraction. The data `locdata` in this package can be a example of the
import data.frame. It must contain five columns in the following order:

-   **No**: Serial number of the locations
-   **location**: Abbreviation of the locations
-   **lon**: Longitude of the locations in decimal digit (negative
    numbers indicating west longitude)
-   **lat**: Latitude of the locations in decimal digit (negative
    numbers indicating south latitude)
-   **altitude**: Altitude of the locations

Other extra columns with information is allowed behind the columns
above, but would be discarded in following process.

After preparing the climate dataset and location information, import the
data.frame and path of three climate datasets into the function `clim_extract`:



```{r extraction,eval=FALSE}
#Example data in this package
data("locdata")
#Modify the path of yours
a <- "G:/climplot/climdata/tmin"
b <- "G:/climplot/climdata/tmax"
c <- "G:/climplot/climdata/prec"

#extraction of climate data

plotdata <- clim_extract(locdata, a, b, c)

```

```{r plotdata,echo=FALSE}
data("plotdata")
p <- plotdata %>% dplyr::filter(No<4)
kable(p,format = "pipe")
```

The exported data.frame includes 5 kinds of information of locations(as which in the data.frame imported), and values of 3 kinds of climate factors across 12 months. A data.frame stores in the data `plotdata` of this package, as an example of the function export.


### Climatic diagram drawing

Take the data `plotdata` and `plotdata_Frost` as an example, and import them into the function `clim_plot`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("plotdata")
loc <- subset(plotdata,No==2)
clim_plot(loc)

```
<img src="vignettes/result.png" alt="plot result" align="center"/>

In the figure above:

-   The red curve represents the annual variation of temperature, and blue one represents of precipitation variation. These two curves form two types of patches indicating humidity and aridity levels. The string-filled patches represent humid seasons while those with scattered points represent arid seasons. The polygon filled with the color same as precipitation curve indicates months with precipitation over 100mm, displaying the wet season.

-   The information on the left top includes the name, the altitude and the coordinates of the locations. The right top are the values of annual mean temperature and mean precipitation.
